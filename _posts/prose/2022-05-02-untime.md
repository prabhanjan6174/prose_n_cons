The dark man stood at the doorway, \
Shadowless in the shadows. \
He had a smile, a frightening smile. \
In his faded Denims and Checkered reds, \
He cast his darkness in the hearts, \
hearts too afraid to make a stand.

The dark man stood at the doorway, \
Shadowless in the shadows. \
He had a plan, a damning plan, \
In his inhuman head and hellish sights. \
He drove the minds of men astray, \
minds bent to his will and servitude.

The dark man was no man, \
His darkness spoke the truth. \
Even on the brightest day, \
his shadow engulfs us all. \
He walks around scorching worlds, \
breaking beams and sowing chaos.

The dark man serves his king, \
with devotion and fright. \
He too serves the beam, \
In his naked ambition, unaware. \
He walks unaware of the threat. \
The man in black walked and \
the gunslinger followed.
