I met a magic man, in magic place, \
he offered me a waY oUt of this mess. \
A magic pill to forget everything, \
i took the pill which tasted like, \
(what did it taste like?) 

Oh i remember, \
I walked down the kaleidoscope, \
i found myself sitting on chair. \
i was drinking a crunchy soup with a fork, \
No wait, i was running in fresh blue fields, \
the grass was bluer than the Pacific. \
The gentle warmth of the autumn breeze \
burnt my skin off and chilled my bone. \
The pill tasted like the soup, like my dreams, \
dry, undercooked and bland. 

The pink sun in the sky, looked like a neon light, \
burning away, all the visible night. \
I remember, climbing up a valley, \
down where the magma flowed. \
The marshmallow trees, were sweet \
sweet all the way, to the core. \
Oh i remember, \
I plucked some apples, from an orange tree. \
pealed the skin and ate the peppermint. 

After all the adventure in the rabbit hole, \
I found myself in my bed waking up to the yellow sun.\
The magic pill was magical like an asphyxiation, \
I ran back to the magic place, to the magic man, \
There was no magic place, to find the magic man.
